Minchakievich came from an Orthodox Ukrainian family and Pasternak came from a Jewish family. Some confusion has arisen as to Pasternak attending a military academy in his boyhood years. The uniforms of their monastery Cadet Corp were only similar to those of The Czar Alexander the Third Military Academy, as Pasternak and Minchakievich never attended any military academy. Most schools used a distinctive military-looking uniform particular to them as was the custom of the time in Eastern Europe and Russia. Boyhood friends, they parted in 1908, friendly but with different politics, never to see each other again. Pasternak went to the Moscow Conservatory to study music (later Germany to study philosophy), and Minchakievich went to L'viv University (L'vov, Lw\u00f3w) to study history and philosophy. The good dimension of the character Strelnikov in <i>Dr. Zhivago<\/i> is based upon Peter Minchakievich. Several of Pasternak's characters are composites. After World War One and the Revolution, fighting for the Provisional or Republican government under Kerensky, and then escaping a Communist jail and execution, Minchakievich trekked across Siberia in 1917 and became an American citizen. Pasternak stayed in Russia.\n<\/p><p>In a 1959 letter to Jacqueline de Proyart, Pasternak recalled:\n<\/p><p>Shortly after his birth, Pasternak's parents had joined the <a href=\"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\"\/Tolstoyan\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Tolstoyan\">Tolstoyan<\/a> Movement.

Once it is undertaken, it is best to divide it into sections long enough for the work to not get stale and to complete one section each day.

The family had a <a href=\"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\"\/Dacha\" title=\"Dacha\">dacha<\/a> (country house) close to one occupied by <a href=\"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\"\/Alexander_Scriabin\" title=\"Alexander Scriabin\">Alexander Scriabin<\/a>. <a href=\"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\"\/Sergei_Rachmaninoff\" title=\"Sergei Rachmaninoff\">Sergei Rachmaninoff<\/a>, <a href=\"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\"\/Rainer_Maria_Rilke\" title=\"Rainer Maria Rilke\">Rainer Maria Rilke<\/a> and <a href=\"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\"\/Leo_Tolstoy\" title=\"Leo Tolstoy\">Leo Tolstoy<\/a> were all visitors to the family home. His father Leonid was a painter who produced one of the most important portraits of Scriabin, and Pasternak wrote many years later of witnessing with great excitement the creation of Scriabin's <a href=\"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\"\/Symphony_No._3_(Scriabin)\" title=\"Symphony No. 3 (Scriabin)\">Symphony No. 3<\/a> (<i>The Divine Poem<\/i>), in 1903.\n<\/p><p>Pasternak began to compose at the age of 13.

His single-movement Piano Sonata of 1909 shows a more mature and individual voice. Nominally in B minor, it moves freely from key to key with frequent changes of key-signature and a chromatic dissonant style that defies easy analysis. Although composed during his time at the Conservatory, the Sonata was composed at Rayki, some 40\u00a0km north-east of Moscow, where Leonid Pasternak had his painting studio and taught his students.\n<\/p><p class=\"mw-empty-elt\">\n<\/p>","bio_image":"full\/ddfe15d526146e5ba0a2f19b004dad92ef243c7f.jpg"},{"link":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Pavel_Cherenkov","name":"Pavel Cherenkov","year":1958,"category":"Physics","country":"Russia and Soviet Union","text":"Pavel Cherenkov , Physics, 1958","date_of_birth":"1904-07-28T00:00:00.000","date_of_death":"1990-01-06T00:00:00.000","place_of_birth":"Novaya Chigla","place_of_death":"Moscow","gender":"male","award_age":54,"born_in":null,"mini_bio":"<p><b>Pavel Alekseyevich Cherenkov<\/b> (<a href=\"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\"\/Russian_language\" title=\"Russian language\">Russian<\/a>: <span lang=\"ru\">\u041f\u0430\u0301\u0432\u0435\u043b \u0410\u043b\u0435\u043a\u0441\u0435\u0301\u0435\u0432\u0438\u0447 \u0427\u0435\u0440\u0435\u043d\u043a\u043e\u0301\u0432<\/span> <small><\/small><span title=\"Representation in the International Phonetic Alphabet (IPA)\" class=\"IPA\" lang=\"ru-Latn-fonipa\"><a href=\"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\"\/Help:IPA\/Russian\" title=\"Help:IPA\/Russian\">[\u02c8pav\u02b2\u026al \u0250l\u02b2\u026ak\u02c8s\u02b2e(j)\u026av\u02b2\u026at\u0255 t\u0255\u026ar\u02b2\u026an\u02c8kof]<\/a><\/span>;
