Asturias combined his extensive knowledge of Mayan beliefs with his political convictions, channeling them into a life of commitment and solidarity. His work is often identified with the social and moral aspirations of the Guatemalan people.\n<\/p><p>After decades of exile and marginalization, Asturias finally received broad recognition in the 1960s. In 1966, he won the Soviet Union's <a href=\"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\"\/Lenin_Peace_Prize\" title=\"Lenin Peace Prize\">Lenin Peace Prize<\/a>.
