Luthuli joined the <a href=\"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\"\/African_National_Congress\" title=\"African National Congress\">African National Congress<\/a> (ANC) in 1944 and was elected the provincial president of the <a href=\"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\"\/Province_of_Natal\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Province of Natal\">Natal<\/a> branch in 1951. A year later in 1952, Luthuli led the <a href=\"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\"\/Defiance_Campaign\" title=\"Defiance Campaign\">Defiance Campaign<\/a> to protest the <a href=\"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\"\/Pass_laws\" title=\"Pass laws\">pass laws<\/a> and other laws of apartheid. As a result, the government removed him from his chief position as he refused to choose between being a member of the ANC or a chief at Groutville. In the same year, he was elected <a href=\"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\"\/President_of_the_African_National_Congress\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"President of the African National Congress\">President-General of the ANC<\/a>. After the <a href=\"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\"\/Sharpeville_massacre\" title=\"Sharpeville massacre\">Sharpeville massacre<\/a>, where sixty-nine Africans were killed, leaders within the ANC such as <a href=\"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\"\/Nelson_Mandela\" title=\"Nelson Mandela\">Nelson Mandela<\/a> believed the organization should take up armed resistance against the government. Luthuli was against the use of violence, but as time passed, he gradually accepted it; however, he stayed committed to nonviolence on a personal level. Following four <a href=\"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\"\/List_of_people_subject_to_banning_orders_under_apartheid\" title=\"List of people subject to banning orders under apartheid\">banning orders<\/a>, the <a href=\"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\"\/Political_prisoners\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Political prisoners\">imprisonment and exile<\/a> of his political allies, and the banning of the ANC, Luthuli's power as President-General gradually waned. The subsequent creation of <a href=\"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\"\/UMkhonto_we_Sizwe\" title=\"UMkhonto we Sizwe\">uMkhonto we Sizwe<\/a>, the ANC's <a href=\"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\"\/Paramilitary\" title=\"Paramilitary\">paramilitary<\/a> wing, marked the anti-apartheid movement's shift from nonviolence to an armed struggle.\n<\/p><p>Inspired by his <a href=\"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\"\/Christian\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Christian\">Christian<\/a> faith and the <a href=\"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\"\/Nonviolent\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Nonviolent\">nonviolent<\/a> methods used by <a href=\"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\"\/Gandhi\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Gandhi\">Gandhi<\/a>, Luthuli was praised for his dedication to <a href=\"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\"\/Nonviolent_resistance\" title=\"Nonviolent resistance\">nonviolent resistance<\/a> against apartheid as well as his vision of a <a href=\"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\"\/Non-racialism\" title=\"Non-racialism\">non-racial<\/a> South African society. In 1961, Luthuli was awarded the 1960 <a href=\"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\"\/Nobel_Peace_Prize\" title=\"Nobel Peace Prize\">Nobel Peace Prize<\/a> for his role in leading the nonviolent <a href=\"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\"\/Internal_resistance_to_apartheid\" title=\"Internal resistance to apartheid\">anti-apartheid movement<\/a>. Luthuli's supporters brand him as a global icon of peace similar to <a href=\"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\"\/Gandhi\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Gandhi\">Gandhi<\/a> and <a href=\"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\"\/Martin_Luther_King_Jr\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Martin Luther King Jr\">Martin Luther King Jr<\/a>, the latter of which claimed to be a follower and admirer of Luthuli. He formed <a href=\"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\"\/Congress_Alliance\" title=\"Congress Alliance\">multi-racial alliances<\/a> with the <a href=\"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\"\/South_African_Indian_Congress\" title=\"South African Indian Congress\">South African Indian Congress<\/a> and the white <a href=\"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\"\/South_African_Congress_of_Democrats\" title=\"South African Congress of Democrats\">Congress of Democrats<\/a>, which drew frequent backlash from <a href=\"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\"\/African_nationalism\" title=\"African nationalism\">Africanists<\/a> in the ANC. The Africanist bloc believed that Africans should not ally themselves with other races due to them being the most disadvantaged race under apartheid.

As South Africa's last head of state from the era of white-minority rule, he and his government dismantled the <a href=\"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\"\/Apartheid\" title=\"Apartheid\">apartheid<\/a> system and introduced <a href=\"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\"\/Universal_suffrage\" title=\"Universal suffrage\">universal suffrage<\/a>. Ideologically a conservative and an <a href=\"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\"\/Economic_liberalism\" title=\"Economic liberalism\">economic liberal<\/a>, he led the <a href=\"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\"\/National_Party_(South_Africa)\" title=\"National Party (South Africa)\">National Party<\/a> (NP) from 1989 to 1997.\n<\/p><p>Born in <a href=\"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\"\/Johannesburg\" title=\"Johannesburg\">Johannesburg<\/a> to an influential <a href=\"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\"\/Afrikaners\" title=\"Afrikaners\">Afrikaner<\/a> family, de Klerk studied at <a href=\"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\"\/Potchefstroom_University\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Potchefstroom University\">Potchefstroom University<\/a> before pursuing a career in law. Joining the NP, to which he had family ties, he was elected to parliament and sat in the <a href=\"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\"\/Dominant_minority\" title=\"Dominant minority\">white-minority government<\/a> of <a href=\"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\"\/P._W._Botha\" title=\"P. W. Botha\">P. W. Botha<\/a>, holding a succession of ministerial posts. As a minister, he supported and enforced apartheid, a system of <a href=\"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\"\/Racial_segregation\" title=\"Racial segregation\">racial segregation<\/a> that privileged <a href=\"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\"\/White_South_Africans\" title=\"White South Africans\">white South Africans<\/a>. After Botha resigned in 1989, de Klerk replaced him, first as leader of the NP and then as State President. Although observers expected him to continue Botha's defence of apartheid, de Klerk decided to end the policy. He was aware that growing ethnic animosity and violence was leading South Africa into a racial civil war. Amid this violence, the state security forces committed widespread human rights abuses and encouraged violence between the <a href=\"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\"\/Xhosa_people\" title=\"Xhosa people\">Xhosa<\/a> and <a href=\"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\"\/Zulu_people\" title=\"Zulu people\">Zulu people<\/a>, although de Klerk later denied sanctioning such actions. He permitted <a href=\"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\"\/Internal_resistance_to_apartheid\" title=\"Internal resistance to apartheid\">anti-apartheid<\/a> marches to take place, legalised a range of previously banned anti-apartheid political parties, and freed imprisoned anti-apartheid activists such as <a href=\"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\"\/Nelson_Mandela\" title=\"Nelson Mandela\">Nelson Mandela<\/a>. He also dismantled <a href=\"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\"\/South_Africa%27s_nuclear_weapons_program\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"South Africa's nuclear weapons program\">South Africa's nuclear weapons program<\/a>.\n<\/p><p>De Klerk negotiated with Mandela to fully dismantle apartheid and establish a transition to universal suffrage. In 1993, he publicly apologized for apartheid's harmful effects. He oversaw the <a href=\"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\"\/1994_South_African_general_election\" title=\"1994 South African general election\">1994 non-racial election<\/a> in which Mandela led the <a href=\"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\"\/African_National_Congress\" title=\"African National Congress\">African National Congress<\/a> (ANC) to victory; de Klerk's NP took second place. De Klerk then became Deputy President in Mandela's ANC-led <a href=\"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\"\/Coalition_government\" title=\"Coalition government\">coalition<\/a>, the <a href=\"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\"\/Cabinet_of_Nelson_Mandela\" title=\"Cabinet of Nelson Mandela\">Government of National Unity<\/a>. In this position, he supported the government's continued liberal economic policies but opposed the <a href=\"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\"\/Truth_and_Reconciliation_Commission_(South_Africa)\" title=\"Truth and Reconciliation Commission (South Africa)\">Truth and Reconciliation Commission<\/a> set up to investigate past <a href=\"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\"\/Human_rights_in_South_Africa\" title=\"Human rights in South Africa\">human rights<\/a> abuses because he wanted total amnesty for political crimes. His working relationship with Mandela was strained, although he later spoke fondly of him. In May 1996, after the NP objected to the <a href=\"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\"\/Constitution_of_South_Africa\" title=\"Constitution of South Africa\">new constitution<\/a>, de Klerk withdrew it from the coalition government; the party disbanded the following year and reformed as the <a href=\"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\"\/New_National_Party_(South_Africa)\" title=\"New National Party (South Africa)\">New National Party<\/a>. In 1997, he retired from active politics and thereafter lectured internationally.\n<\/p><p>De Klerk was a controversial figure among many sections of South African society, all for different reasons. He received many awards, including the <a href=\"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\"\/Nobel_Peace_Prize\" title=\"Nobel Peace Prize\">Nobel Peace Prize<\/a> for dismantling apartheid and bringing universal suffrage to South Africa. Conversely, he received criticism from anti-apartheid activists for offering only a qualified apology for apartheid, and for ignoring the human rights abuses by state security forces. He was also condemned by pro-apartheid Afrikaners, who contended that by abandoning apartheid, he betrayed the interests of the country's Afrikaner minority.\n<\/p>","bio_image":"full\/3086806b95dc2b18d7f0c1550f656bc7e4681a73.jpg"}]
