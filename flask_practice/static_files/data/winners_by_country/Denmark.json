Although the Bohr model has been supplanted by other models, its underlying principles remain valid. He conceived the principle of <a href=\"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\"\/Complementarity_(physics)\" title=\"Complementarity (physics)\">complementarity<\/a>: that items could be separately analysed in terms of contradictory properties, like behaving as a <a href=\"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\"\/Wave%E2%80%93particle_duality\" title=\"Wave\u2013particle duality\">wave or a stream of particles<\/a>.

After <a href=\"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\"\/German_invasion_of_Denmark_(1940)\" title=\"German invasion of Denmark (1940)\">Denmark was occupied by the Germans<\/a>, he had a famous meeting with Heisenberg, who had become the head of the <a href=\"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\"\/German_nuclear_weapon_project\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"German nuclear weapon project\">German nuclear weapon project<\/a>.
