Today, particles that obey the exclusion principle are called \"<a href=\"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\"\/Fermion\" title=\"Fermion\">fermions<\/a>\".

Marconi established a wireless transmitting station at Marconi House, <a href=\"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\"\/Rosslare_Strand\" title=\"Rosslare Strand\">Rosslare Strand<\/a>, <a href=\"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\"\/County_Wexford\" title=\"County Wexford\">County Wexford<\/a>, in 1901 to act as a link between <a href=\"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\"\/Poldhu\" title=\"Poldhu\">Poldhu<\/a> in <a href=\"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\"\/Cornwall\" title=\"Cornwall\">Cornwall<\/a>, England, and <a href=\"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\"\/Clifden\" title=\"Clifden\">Clifden<\/a> in <a href=\"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\"\/Connemara\" title=\"Connemara\">Connemara<\/a>, <a href=\"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\"\/County_Galway\" title=\"County Galway\">County Galway<\/a>, Ireland. He soon made the announcement that the message was received at <a href=\"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\"\/Signal_Hill_(Newfoundland_and_Labrador)\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Signal Hill (Newfoundland and Labrador)\">Signal Hill<\/a> in <a href=\"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\"\/St._John%27s,_Newfoundland_and_Labrador\" title=\"St. John's, Newfoundland and Labrador\">St. John's<\/a>, <a href=\"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\"\/Newfoundland_and_Labrador\" title=\"Newfoundland and Labrador\">Newfoundland<\/a> (now part of <a href=\"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\"\/Canada\" title=\"Canada\">Canada<\/a>), on 12 December 1901, using a 500-foot (150\u00a0m) kite-supported antenna for reception\u2014signals transmitted by the company's new high-power station at <a href=\"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\"\/Poldhu\" title=\"Poldhu\">Poldhu<\/a>, Cornwall. The distance between the two points was about 2,200 miles (3,500\u00a0km). It was heralded as a great scientific advance, yet there also was\u2014and continues to be\u2014considerable scepticism about this claim. The exact wavelength used is not known, but it is fairly reliably determined to have been in the neighbourhood of 350 meters (frequency \u2248 850\u00a0kHz). The tests took place at a time of day during which the entire transatlantic path was in daylight. It is now known (although Marconi did not know then) that this was the worst possible choice. At this medium wavelength, long-distance transmission in the daytime is not possible because of heavy absorption of the skywave in the ionosphere. It was not a blind test; Marconi knew in advance to listen for a repetitive signal of three clicks, signifying the Morse code letter <i>S<\/i>. The clicks were reported to have been heard faintly and sporadically. There was no independent confirmation of the reported reception, and the transmissions were difficult to distinguish from atmospheric noise. A detailed technical review of Marconi's early transatlantic work appears in John S. Belrose's work of 1995. The Poldhu transmitter was a two-stage circuit.<sup id=\"cite_ref-50\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Guglielmo_Marconi#\"cite_note-50\">[50]<\/a><\/sup><sup id=\"cite_ref-51\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Guglielmo_Marconi#\"cite_note-51\">[51]<\/a><\/sup>\n<\/p><p>Feeling challenged by sceptics, Marconi prepared a better organised and documented test. In February 1902, the SS <i>Philadelphia<\/i> sailed west from Great Britain with Marconi aboard, carefully recording signals sent daily from the Poldhu station. The test results produced <a href=\"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\"\/Magnetic_detector\" title=\"Magnetic detector\">coherer-tape<\/a> reception up to 1,550 miles (2,490\u00a0km), and audio reception up to 2,100 miles (3,400\u00a0km). The maximum distances were achieved at night, and these tests were the first to show that radio signals for <a href=\"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\"\/Medium_wave\" title=\"Medium wave\">medium wave<\/a> and <a href=\"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\"\/Longwave\" title=\"Longwave\">longwave<\/a> transmissions travel much farther at night than in the day. During the daytime, signals had been received up to only about 700 miles (1,100\u00a0km), less than half of the distance claimed earlier at Newfoundland, where the transmissions had also taken place during the day. Because of this, Marconi had not fully confirmed the Newfoundland claims, although he did prove that radio signals could be sent for hundreds of kilometres (miles), despite some scientists' belief that they were limited essentially to line-of-sight distances.\n<\/p><p>On 17 December 1902, a transmission from the Marconi station in <a href=\"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\"\/Glace_Bay\" title=\"Glace Bay\">Glace Bay<\/a>, Nova Scotia, Canada, became the world's first radio message to cross the Atlantic from North America. In 1901, Marconi built a station near <a href=\"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\"\/Wellfleet,_Massachusetts\" title=\"Wellfleet, Massachusetts\">South Wellfleet, Massachusetts<\/a>, that sent a message of greetings on 18 January 1903 from United States President <a href=\"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\"\/Theodore_Roosevelt\" title=\"Theodore Roosevelt\">Theodore Roosevelt<\/a> to <a href=\"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\"\/King_Edward_VII\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"King Edward VII\">King Edward VII<\/a> of the United Kingdom.
