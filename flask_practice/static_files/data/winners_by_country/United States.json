During his first year as president, Wilson authorized the widespread <a href=\"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\"\/Woodrow_Wilson_and_race\" title=\"Woodrow Wilson and race\">imposition of segregation<\/a> inside the federal bureaucracy. His first term was largely devoted to pursuing passage of his progressive <a href=\"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\"\/The_New_Freedom\" title=\"The New Freedom\">New Freedom<\/a> domestic agenda.

In April 1917, Wilson asked Congress for a declaration of war against Germany in response to its policy of unrestricted submarine warfare that sank American merchant ships. Wilson nominally presided over war-time mobilization and left military matters to the generals. He instead concentrated on diplomacy, issuing the <i><a href=\"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\"\/Fourteen_Points\" title=\"Fourteen Points\">Fourteen Points<\/a><\/i> that the Allies and Germany accepted as a basis for post-war peace. He wanted the off-year elections of 1918 to be a referendum endorsing his policies, but instead the Republicans took control of Congress. After the <a href=\"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\"\/Armistice_of_11_November_1918\" title=\"Armistice of 11 November 1918\">Allied victory<\/a> in November 1918, Wilson went to Paris where he and the British and French leaders dominated the <a href=\"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\"\/Paris_Peace_Conference_(1919%E2%80%931920)\" title=\"Paris Peace Conference (1919\u20131920)\">Paris Peace Conference<\/a>.
